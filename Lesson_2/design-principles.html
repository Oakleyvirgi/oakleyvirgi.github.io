      <h3>Proximity</h3>
      <p>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints<br></p>

      <p>The principle of proximity means that in order for two or more items to have a relationship they must be near
        to each other. In the webpage above the items are near each other representing a category. For instance, the
        first three items on the top of the page are an official announcement or videos about the prophet/apostles.
        Followed by four items that are messages or words of the general membership. Then, the quick links are grouped
        together. After that, "more features" which are videos or messages of members of Church serving others, or
        members of the first presidency inviting others to participate in service activities. Lastly, the social media
        information and icons/links.</p>

      <h3>Alignment</h3>

      <p>The alignment principle is that every item should have a visual connection with something else in the page.
        This is illustrated in the webpage above for the colors of the main icon are displayed throughout the rest of
        the website, all the text or images are in a square shape, and the "about us" information that is centered in
        the page matches the bottom of the page where the social media icons/links are located.</p>

      <h3>Repetition</h3>

      <p>The principle of repetition is that some aspect of the design needs to be repeated in the piece, this
        provides consistency. The webpage above repeats the colors blue, yellow, black, gray, and white throughout the
        page. The icons are in a circle shape are the bank services to clients, the rates are in a rectangular shape,
        and the news/ resources in a square shape. </p>
